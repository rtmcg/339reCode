The following error occurred when I powered off the Geiger counter in the middle of a run.
I wanted to see how long the timeout for collecting data is, because there's mention of 2000 seconds as a timeout in the Python code.
It was more like 2 seconds...


<begin console>
Replica # 1. Interval # 59. Interval length received: 2876.0
Verbose got resp: '' 

Traceback (most recent call last):

    intervals[replica,interval] = arduino.getInterval() # GetInterval() has a 2000 second timeout, but will finish once a click happens

  File "C:\Users\rturne11\Downloads\339reCode\geigerDwellTime_python3_edit.py", line 92, in getInterval
    return int(resp) # return resp as int

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''
